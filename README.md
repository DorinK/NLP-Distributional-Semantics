# NLP-Distributional-Semantics
Third Assignment in 'NLP - Natural Languages Processing' course by Prof. Yoav Goldberg, Prof. Ido Dagan and Prof. Reut Tsarfaty at Bar-Ilan University.

**<ins>Goal:</ins>**
The goal of this assignment is to compute distributional similarities for words based on corpus data and to assess and evaluate those similarities.

**<ins>The assignment consists of the following parts:</ins>**
* The first parts are about computing word similarity using vectors in the original feature space, which I built using corpus statistics.
* Then, in the last part, I computed similarities in an analogous manner using pre-trained word2vec word embeddings.

**<ins>Score:</ins>** 100
